# WHOI-ML: About This Repository
This Repository contains notes, resources, and assignments for a Machine Learning Bootcamp for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

# About This Document
This ReadMe outlines the content of the bootcamp, provides installation instructions for the required software packages, and suggests background reading material for extended study.

# System Requirements
Any machine with an up-to-date popular desktop operating system (Mac OS, Windows, Ubuntu, e.g.) and a modern web browser installed will be sufficient for this course. That said, machine learning can be computationally intensive, so higher-end CPU's will save time, and machines with NVidia GPUs _may_ be able to leverage them for faster training of neural networks, in the section of the course pertaining to that. However, modest hardware will still be sufficient for the purpose of the course.

# Software Packages
This program uses many software packages, but fortunately will only require two installs, as a large number of the packages we will use come packaged with Anaconda.  
1. [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). If offered a choice, download and install the package with the most recent version of Python (3.7). Anaconda is a scientific computing package that bundles many software packages and libraries we will be using in the course, including Python, Jupyter Notebooks, the conda package manager, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tqdm, and many more.
2. [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). PyTorch is a deep-learning library (comparable to Tensorflow) with a shallow learning curve and high flexibility. This is easiest to do through the command line, using the conda package manager. In the "Getting Started" section, you can choose the install command that fits your environment. Note that if you are not running on a CUDA-supported NVidia GPU, you should choose "none" to install only the CPU version of PyTorch. Windows users may need to run the installation command through Power Shell or by going through Anaconda Navigator > Environments > base (root) > Open Terminal.
3. Test the installation by opening a new Jupyter notebook and running  
`import torch`  
`print(torch.__version__)`    
Jupyter notebooks can be opened by either running `jupyter notebook` from a shell/terminal or by going through the Anaconda Navigator > Jupyter Notebooks. Either option should open a page in your web browser that will allow you to browse files and create a new notebook by clicking new > Python 3. Type the code above into a cell, and then execute the cell by pressing Shift+Enter.

# Background Reading:
No prior knowledge of Machine Learning is assumed in this course, but a strong programming background is assumed. The course will be exclusively in Python, and participants may want to review some of the following pages so that they can focus exclusively on Machine Learning once the course begins.  
- [Python Cheat Sheet](https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/_media/python:cours:mementopython3-english.pdf). Feel free to search or follow a tutorial if anything needs clarification.
- [Python Classes/Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)
- [Python Special Methods](https://micropyramid.com/blog/python-special-class-methods-or-magic-methods/) (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.). There is a gentler introduction [here](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods).
- [Functional Programming](https://kite.com/blog/python/functional-programming/)
- [Debugging in Python](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/). Although Jupyter notebooks make interactive programming and introspection through `print` statements very flexible, `pdb` may still be useful to developers aiming at 10x engineer status.

# Additional Resources:
These resources will not be used in this course, but those hoping to explore some areas in greater detail may find them worth looking into.

### Reinforcement Learning
For those interested in doing more reinforcement learning experiments (on Markov Decision Processes, not Bandit Problems), the libraries `gym` and `simple_rl` may be helpful. These can be installed through a python package manager, such as `conda` or `pip`.
